# Visualization
Used IPL Dataset and tried to find out some useful insights like Number of matches, team won matches in a season, no. of tosses won by a team and the match after they won, highest scorer, top wicket takers, venues and the team won matches at that venue and many more.

Did visualization of KPMG's virtual internship data. The data consisted the information about the consumers of Australia like vehicles they have, source of income, pension, duration of the vehicle, etc.

The Sales report is the information about the orders, people and information about the returned products.

The last one is the NHS data report. NHS is the UK's biggest health organization. Using their data, I tried to understand the insights of test requests, and actual test information, and share the reports of those tests.
